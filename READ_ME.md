*Reinforcement Learning-Based Toll Plaza Lane Optimization*
Problem Statement
Traffic congestion at toll plazas leads to delays, inefficiencies, and increased fuel consumption. Traditional static lane allocation methods are not adaptive to fluctuating traffic conditions, causing bottlenecks during peak hours. This project aims to optimize toll lane allocation dynamically using reinforcement learning (RL), specifically leveraging Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to reduce congestion and ensure smoother vehicle flow.

**Approach**
1.	Data Collection & Processing:
	Real-time or historical toll transaction data is analyzed.
	The dataset includes attributes like initiated_time, hour, lane, direction, txn_amount, and vehicle_type.
	Data is cleaned and processed to extract relevant features such as hourly traffic volume.
2.	Reinforcement Learning (DQN) Implementation:
	State Space: Represents the current traffic conditions, including the number of vehicles per lane.
	Action Space: Represents possible lane allocation changes (e.g., increasing car lanes, reducing truck lanes).
	Reward Function: Designed to minimize congestion, penalizing high wait times and rewarding smooth traffic flow.
	Training: The model learns by interacting with simulated toll transactions and adjusting lane allocations dynamically.
3.	Simulation & Evaluation:
	A simulation runs from 12 AM to 11 PM to test the model’s decision-making at different traffic volumes.
	The RL model dynamically adjusts lane configurations based on observed traffic patterns.
	Metrics such as transaction throughput and average wait time are recorded to assess performance.

*Execution Steps*

_Prerequisites_

Ensure you have the following installed:
pip install stable-baselines3 pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn gym

Steps to Execute
1.	Prepare the dataset
	Load the toll transaction dataset (e.g., toll_data.csv).
	Perform data preprocessing to extract necessary features.
2.	Define the RL Environment
	Set up the toll plaza simulation environment.
	Define the state space (traffic volume per lane) and action space (lane allocations).
	Establish a reward function that penalizes congestion and rewards smooth flow.
3.	Train the RL Model
	Utilize the DQN algorithm to train the agent.
	Set hyperparameters and train for a sufficient number of timesteps.
4.	Run Simulations
	Test the trained model over different hours of the day.
	Observe the lane adjustments and evaluate efficiency.
5.	Analyze Results
	Compare lane reallocation strategies during peak vs. non-peak hours.
	Assess congestion reduction and wait-time improvements.

*Results & Insights*
•	The RL model dynamically adjusts lanes based on real-time traffic volume.
•	Peak hours (hourly transaction rate >1750) trigger lane reallocation.
•	The learned policy reduces congestion by optimizing lane usage effectively.

*Future Improvements*
•	Multi-Agent RL: Simulating multiple toll plazas working in coordination.
•	Integration with Navigation Systems: Using GPS data to predict traffic surges.
•	Deployment in Real-Time Scenarios: Implementing on a cloud-based platform for live decision-making.
